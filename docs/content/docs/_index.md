Welcome to the Jiiify Presentation project's documentation. This documentation is specific to JPv3 (version 3 of the library).

On the left are the documentation topics. Most folks will want to either start with building the library from source or getting the official release to use in their own 
projects.

{{< button "./building/" "Build from source" >}} {{< button "./using-jar/" "Use official release" >}}

If you're interested in JPv3's compliance with the IIIF Presentation standard, you might be interested in the IIIF compliance documentation. It documents compliance 
using the IIIF Cookbook recipes as a test suite. Alternatively, you might want to view some code examples based on the IIIF Cookbook recipes.
