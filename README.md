A [IIIF Presentation](http://iiif.io/api/presentation) library for Java. It does not contain a server. It's meant to be used in a server or it can be used from a command line / GUI application that generates 
presentation manifests from files on disk, etc.

This is a work in progress and should not be considered stable.

### Getting Started

To check out and build the project, type on the command line:

    git clone https://github.com/ksclarke/jiiify-presentation.git
    cd jiiify-presentation
    mvn install

This will put the jar in your local Maven repository and you can reference it from your project.

To build the Javadocs, from the command line, run: `mvn javadoc:javadoc`
